<p class="control">
  <label>{{ label() }}</label>
  <!-- only input and text area is selected -->
   <!--Angular doesn't care which markup would end up in component eventually  
   It only cares about what it sees in component template
   there it see placeholder ng-content
   -->
   <!-- What can we do then
   We can disable the scoping of css 
   By default component styles are scoped to the component which they belong.
   They can't affect anything out of component
   -->
   <!-- But here we want the styles to affect 
   So FIX IS:   encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.None 
   -->
  <ng-content select="input, textarea"/>
